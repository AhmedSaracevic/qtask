Wordpress local setup
    Since I already had all the prerequsities set up (Php,mysql,apache,necessary extensions etc)
    I proceeded with Wordpress installation. Making folders, setting up permissions, setting up apache
    configuration,paths, local domain etc.
    I downloaded lastest Wordpress version to a assigned directory.
    After that I created db using mysql cli commands.
    Then I configured wp-config.php file to make connection to the db.
    After that I loaded Wordpress installer and configured all the other stuff left.

API_login
    I created simple form to take in email and password.In functions.php of the theme
    I added handler which will take inputs from the form and run it against given API
    endpoint.If credentials are matched, it will return status 200 and store a token
    to a cookie.

Movies plugin
    I created simple plugin which will add the custom post type. I also created
    custom theme just to keep things simple and easy.
